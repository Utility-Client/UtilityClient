UtilityClient is a free, open-source and lightweight Client for the game "Minecraft" running currently on a FabricMC
backend.
There's also a mod loader included for Add-ons, which can be programmed in Java.

Currently only Version 1.8.9 of Minecraft is supported, but other versions are planned in the near future.
